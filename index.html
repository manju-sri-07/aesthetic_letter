            <b>Dear Jai 💟,</b>
            <br /><br />
            I hope this letter finds you with the same smile that lights up my world every single day. Words often fall short when it comes to expressing how much you mean to me, but today, I want to try.
            <br /><br />
            From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. The colors became brighter, the laughter grew louder, and the love I once only dreamed of became a beautiful reality. You are the kind of person I thought existed only in fairy tales—a partner, a best friend, and my greatest supporter.
            <br /><br />
            Every little thing you do fills my heart with so much joy—the way you laugh, the way your eyes sparkle when you're happy, and the way you always know how to make me feel special. With you, the ordinary moments turn into extraordinary memories.
            <br /><br />
            You’ve taught me what it truly means to love and be loved. You’ve shown me the beauty of vulnerability and the strength in standing together, no matter what life throws our way. Your kindness, your patience, and the way you make everyone around you feel cared for inspire me every day to be the best version of myself.
            <br /><br />
            I want you to know that you are my safe place, my heart’s home. I cherish every moment we spend together, and I look forward to a future filled with more laughter, more adventures, and an endless supply of love.
            <br /><br />
            You are my sunshine on cloudy days, my calm in the storm, and my dream come true. Thank you for being you—beautiful, loving, and absolutely perfect in my eyes.
            <br /><br />
            I love you, now and always.
            <br /><br />
            Forever yours,
